    "## RL Train Cycle Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to walk through the RL fit cycle to familiarize ourselves with the `Events` cycle and get a better understanding of how `Callback` and `Environment` classes work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High Level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "At the highest level, we have the `Environment` class. The `Environment` holds together several sub-modules and orchestrates them during the fit loop. The following are contained in the `Environment`:\n",
    "- `agent` - This is the actual model we're training\n",
    "- `template_cb` - this holds a `Template` class that we use to define our chemical space\n",
    "- `samplers` - samplers generate new samples to train on\n",
    "- `buffer` - the buffer collects and distributes samples from all the `samplers`\n",
    "- `rewards` - rewards score samples\n",
    "- `losses` - losses generate values we can backpropagate through \n",
    "- `log` - the log holds a record of all samples in the training process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callbacks and the Event Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of the above items is a `Callback`. A `Callback` is a a general class that can hook into the `Environment` fit cycle at a number of pre-defined `Events`. When the `Environment` calls a specific `Event`, the event name is passed to every callback in the `Environment`. If a given `Callback` has a defined function named after the event, that function is called. This creates a very flexible system for customizing training loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be looking more at `Events` later. For now, we'll just list them in brief. These are the events called during the RL training cycle in the order they are executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `setup` - called when the `Environment` is created, used to set up values\n",
    "- `before_train` - called before training is started\n",
    "- `build_buffer` - draws samples from `samplers` into the `buffer`\n",
    "- `filter_buffer` - filters samples in the buffer\n",
    "- `after_build_buffer` - called after buffer filtering. Used for cleanup, logging, etc\n",
    "- `before_batch` - called before a batch starts, used to set up the `batch state`\n",
    "- `sample_batch` - samples are drawn from `sampers` and `buffer` into the `batch state`\n",
    "- `before_filter_batch` - allows preprocessing of samples before filtering\n",
    "- `filter_batch` - filters samples in `batch state`\n",
    "- `after_sample` - used for calculating sampling metrics\n",
    "- `before_compute_reward` - used to set up any values needed for reward computation \n",
    "- `compute_reward` - used by `rewards` to compute rewards for all samples in the `batch state`\n",
    "- `after_compute_reward` - used for logging reward metrics\n",
    "- `reward_modification` - modify rewards in ways not tracked by the log\n",
    "- `after_reward_modification` - log reward modification metrics\n",
    "- `get_model_outputs` - generate necessary tensors from the model\n",
    "- `after_get_model_outputs` - used for any processing required prior to loss calculation \n",
    "- `compute_loss` - compute loss values\n",
    "- `zero_grad` - zero grad\n",
    "- `before_step` - used for computation before optimizer step (ie gradient clipping)\n",
    "- `step` - step optimizer\n",
    "- `after_batch` - compute batch stats\n",
    "- `after_train` - final event after all training batches"
